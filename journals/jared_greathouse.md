Began making a model map in excalidraw that maps out the models and their relationships. Made issues to create model queries and group members assigned themselves to them.
We realized that we need to continue fleshing out the model maps to figure out what queries to make and how to break up our microservices.
My ah-ha moment today was realizing that I cannot wait for the mongo db lecture.

created issues that corresponded to our API endpoints and user stories. We got the fastapi docs page running locally, but mongo database is acting strange
Reflected on the fact that our endpoint list is not comprehensive.
My ah-ha moment was that we are now getting our project off the ground and feeling more capable of finishing this mod 3 project.
