## July 7, 2021

Today, I worked on:

* Connecting mongodb and adding fast_api dependencies

We created mongo-db volumes in docker, updated the docker-composer.yaml with three services: mongo, fast-api, and ghi. We also registered pymongo in requirements.txt. We built and ran the docker images. FastAPI docs page ran locally using docker compose successfully.

After that, I worked on my part of the user stories, which are endpoints 9-12. I also created issues in git lab according to the user stories.

* Goal for this week:
FastAPI docs page running locally using docker compose
Create journal files if they are not made already
Take MVP and put it in the readme.md
Any API work/docs need to be in the readme.md
