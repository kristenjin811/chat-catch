## Features of Chat Catch include:

* Real-time messaging: Chat Catch allows users to communicate in real-time with other users in their chat room.

* Group chat: Chat Catch allows users to create and join group chat rooms for multiple users to communicate in.

* User profiles: Chat Catch allows users to create a profile with a username and password for logging in and accessing their multiple chat rooms.

## Future content / Planned additions

*  We plan on allowing users to select from a range of pre-defined reactions to posts and comments, such as a "thumbs up" or "heart" icon. This will add an additional layer of engagement and feedback for users.

* To support personalized accounts, we will allow users to create their own profiles with unique usernames and profile pictures. This will allow users to easily identify and connect with each other.

* In addition, we plan on implementing voice call functionality so that users can communicate with each other in real-time. This will enhance the sense of community and allow for more efficient communication.
