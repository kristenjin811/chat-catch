    Worked together with group to get our FastAPI docs page running locally using docker compose. (Small victories are the best ones (>^_^)>)



11/16/2022:
    Today was a lot of clerical work for me. Getting a little more familair with out project, setting up docker stuff etc.. I helped Wenqi with her docker today which actually took up quite a bit of time. We finally figured out the solution which was basically just destroying and rebuilding the containers.



11/17/2022:
    All we really did today was attempt to make endpoints.(Some more succesful than others). Didn't really get super far with this, but we are making progress and I'm excited to really start coding on the project.

    It's been a while since I've written in here. I'm startin to feel a bit overwhelmed with the amount of new stuff we are learning + being on a timer with this project. Wenqi and I unsuccesfully have tried to implement authentication. We tried all day but ended up getting stuck on an error we couldn't solve. Idk. This is starting to get a little overwhelming. :(



11/24/2022:
    Well, miraculously our error just randomly solved itself! Made more progress on authentication today. I've kinda turned into the one to get this implemented while Dean and Jared solve our websocket issue. They are planning on using SocketIO.

    Coming back from break, not gonna lie, feeling pretty demotivated. But I guess thats always the case coming back from long breaks. Authentication not really clicking for me, oh well. Guess it's really just part of the process. We're getting there!

    Been 3 days since my last entry in here. (I'm really bad at remembering to this journal LOL) I've decicded to ditch the authentaction stuff for now and started working on our React front end. Got the login page done today. Just gotta get the logut and sign up function working.



12/1/2022:
    I'm super stuck. I thought that maybe I could implement authentication soley through our front end and I've just hit a brick wall. I've must've watched 2 hours of videos implementing it today but nothing seems to work.  :/ On the bright side, deplyoment is going well! My team is great, even though moral seems to be a little low right now. Just gotta push through.



12/2/2022:
    Got the regestration page done today. The functionality between the login and registration page work with each other now! I've given up trying to implement authenticion through the front end and I'm going to go back to the matierial we were given. Thought maybe I had a bright idea for our project, but room for creativty comes later. We just gotta get this thing finished for now.

    Just took the weekend off really. Got a bit sick over the weekend so I just took it easy.
