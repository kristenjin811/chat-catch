    Finished making API endpoints for planning phase.
        1. List of chatrooms
        2. Show a selected chatroom
        3. Send a message
        4. Delete a message
   


## 11/15/2022:
    Worked together with group to get our FastAPI docs page running locally using docker compose. (Small victories are the best ones (>^_^)>)



## 11/16/2022:
    Today was a lot of clerical work for me. Getting a little more familair with out project, setting up docker stuff etc.. I helped Wenqi with her docker today which actually took up quite a bit of time. We finally figured out the solution which was basically just destroying and rebuilding the containers.



## 11/17/2022:
    All we really did today was attempt to make endpoints.(Some more succesful than others). Didn't really get super far with this, but we are making progress and I'm excited to really start coding on the project.
    


## 11/23/2022:
    It's been a while since I've written in here. I'm startin to feel a bit overwhelmed with the amount of new stuff we are learning + being on a timer with this project. Wenqi and I unsuccesfully have tried to implement authentication. We tried all day but ended up getting stuck on an error we couldn't solve. Idk. This is starting to get a little overwhelming. :(



## 11/24/2022:
    Well, miraculously our error just randomly solved itself! Made more progress on authentication today. I've kinda turned into the one to get this implemented while Dean and Jared solve our websocket issue. They are planning on using SocketIO.



## 11/28/2022:
    Coming back from break, not gonna lie, feeling pretty demotivated. But I guess thats always the case coming back from long breaks. Authentication not really clicking for me, oh well. Guess it's really just part of the process. We're getting there!



## 11/31/2022:
    Been 3 days since my last entry in here. (I'm really bad at remembering to this journal LOL) I've decicded to ditch the authentaction stuff for now and started working on our React front end. Got the login page done today. Just gotta get the logut and sign up function working.



## 12/1/2022:
    I'm super stuck. I thought that maybe I could implement authentication soley through our front end and I've just hit a brick wall. I've must've watched 2 hours of videos implementing it today but nothing seems to work.  :/ On the bright side, deplyoment is going well! My team is great, even though moral seems to be a little low right now. Just gotta push through.



## 12/2/2022:
    Got the registration page done today. The functionality between the login and registration page work with each other now! I've given up trying to implement authenticion through the front end and I'm going to go back to the matierial we were given. Thought maybe I had a bright idea for our project, but room for creativty comes later. We just gotta get this thing finished for now.



## 12/3-4/2022:
    Just took the weekend off really. Got a bit sick over the weekend so I just took it easy.



## 12/5/2022:
    Started really working on the back end auth today. Getting pretty far but relating a lot of this code back to our endpoints we need has proven to be pretty difficult. Group morale does seem to be going up as I know Jared is making decen progress with websockets. I need to get this auth finished asap becuase a lot of the websocket stuff won't work without the authentication working from the back end. Should be done within a couple days though.


## 12/6/2022:
    A lot of the endpoints were made today and they seem to be making tokens and doing well, should be done with it by tomorrow. I did get stuck on an error that took FOREVER, but with the help of another group, they were able to give us good information. Dean and I ended up getting it fixed. We ran into some other smaller erros but those didnt take to long to get fixed.


## 12/7/2022:
    Finished the auth! Was prtty tough doing it by myself but I am glad I did. I do feel pretty accomplished. Now, Wenqi and I are going to start to implement it into our react and front end code. Dean and Jared have been working with a lot of people trying to get websockets to be made and bug free, hope that gets fixed soon. Deadline is starting to get a little scary.


## 12/8/2022:
    Today was a lot of success. Wenqi and I were able to get the login, register, and logout feature to work. Now we do have some bugs that need to get fixed but once we get those sorted out, I think we are going to have our MVP done soon. I had to go a little earlier today, but I think Wenqi and Dean got a good amount of bugs sorted out. I've got a great team!



## 12/9/2022:
    
    We were struggling with some authentication stuff and getting it to connect to the frontend, but we were finally able to get it fully finished today. Also, we were able to implement the create a chatroom feature



## 12/10/2022:
    Spent the day finishing the readme.md and going through our old API endpoints and correcting them. Tried to make it pretty at least. Also helped others with their unit tests.
