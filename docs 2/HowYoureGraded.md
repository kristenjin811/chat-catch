How You're Graded
Of course, we're all interested on how this is graded, amirite?

Required technology and features
For the Module 3 project, you must comply with the following requirements to get full marks:

You must use FastAPI for your Web server backend. That means no Django.
You must have a log in/log out feature. When someone logs in, the person should have more functionality than when they're not logged in.
You must have a database, either MongoDB or PostgreSQL. You can make that decision when you get into it.
You must use React to build a Single-Page Application (SPA).
You must deploy the front-end and back-end of your application.
Group grade
55% Features: the majority of your grade will the completeness and correctness of the features deployed into a staging environment. (These do not have to be all of the features in your MVP, but it should be the lion share of them.) Each person on the team will have to write at least one unit test that runs in continuous integration.
5% Code cleanliness: if your code formatting and syntax is all over the place, you will get points deducted. Hiring managers will be reviewing the code in this project, so let's make sure it's easy to read. Use black on the Python files. Use "Format Document" in Visual Studio Code on your JavaScript files.
5% Documentation: The README.md file for the project and associated files in your docs directory should accurately represent what the application is, what it does, how it's built, what the future of the application would be, have correct spelling and grammar, and contain links to the deployed application in its staging environment. This is also something that hiring managers will look at, so do it right for them (and for this grade). Here's an example of a very nice README.md
Individual grade
30% Peer review: Your team will review you, too. If you slack off or don't do anything, then you will fail this project, friend.

Your teammates will score you on the following criteria:

Confidence: Your apparent belief that they can accomplish a task
Coordination: Your ability to set, plan, monitor, and complete tasks within a specific time frame
Control: Your ability to diagnose and solve their own bugs
Composure: Your ability to remain calm and have a positive attitude when things go wrong
Commitment: Your ability to stay on task, ignore distractions, act on feedback, and recover from setbacks
Collaboration: Your ability to work with you and others to achieve common goals
They will then be asked Would you be willing to work with this person, again? The answer to this question is up to half of the 30% of the peer review.

5% Journal entries: the completeness (what you did, what you learned) and frequency of your entries (checked with Git commits).
